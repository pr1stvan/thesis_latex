Physical simulations were always an important field in computing technology. 
Initially, the simulation results were printed out on paper, 
but the evolution of computer hardware made 
it feasible to render the simulations in real time. 

The aim of the thesis is to load and 
render simulation data in real time from two file extensions 
using OpenGL. 
The first file format is prt, 
which was created for storing compressed particle data. 
The files intended for rendering 
are storing the output of a particle based snow simulation. 
The second format is vtp, 
which is able to store both particle and triangle-mesh data. 
During the rendering of prt files, 
an additional goal was to increase the number of particles 
without relinquishing real time speed.
 
I developed two applications for the two file formats. 
In the process, 
I have grown familiar with the modern OpenGL, 
and with popular tools helping to create a graphical application. 

After a short introduction, 
the thesis begins with the 
description of the two file formats used for physical simulations. 
After that, 
the two applications are described covering the graphical user interface, 
the libraries used for developing, and the implementation details.
